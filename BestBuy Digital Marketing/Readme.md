## RFM Analysis

![Alt Text](https://github.com/rhnyewale/INFO7374-Algorithmic-Digital-Marketing/blob/master/FinalProject/Images/RFM%20Analysis.jpg)<br/>
RFM stands for Recency, Frequency, and Monetary. It is the easiest form of customer database segmentation and is based on user activity data. RFM segmentation can be applied to activity-related data that has measurable value and repeatable. Therefore, it is a perfect strategy for eCommerce, because purchase history and website visits can be measured and tracked. Letâ€™s look at each of the RFM components in more detail:<br/>

1.<b>Recency:</b> Recency is the most important predictor of who is more likely to respond to an offer. Customers who have purchased recently from you are more likely to purchase again from you compared to those who did not purchase recently.<br/>
2.<b>Frequency:</b> The second most important factor is how frequently these customers purchase from you. The higher the frequency, the higher is the chances of them responding to your offers.<br/>
3.<b>Monetary:</b> The third factor is the amount of money that customers have spent on purchases. Customers, who have spent higher amounts, are more likely to purchase compared to those who have spent less.<br/>


## Promotional Strategies
After predicting the next purchase date of the customer our strategy should be to expedite the purchase by the customer.<br/>
We have created different strategies on the basis of prediction and RFM scores<br/>

On the basis of next purchase prediction and RFM Analysis we will be sending 3 different Mails for different customers.<br/>
1.

## Customer Lifetime Value and Churn Rate Calculation

Customer Lifetime Value is a monetary value that represents the amount of revenue or profit a customer will give the company over the period of the relationship.<br/>
CLTV demonstrates the implications of acquiring long-term customers compared to short-term customers.<br/> 
Customer lifetime value (CLTV) can help you to answers the most important questions about sales to every company:<br/>
<ul>
<li>Identify the most profitable customers</li>
<li>Formulate how can a company offer the best products and make the most money</li>
<li>Calculate how much budget is needed to spend to acquire customers</li>
</ul>
<b>Churn rate Calculation</b><br/>
<ul>
<li>Repeat Rate = Number of Customer who have ordered in last 3 months / Total Number of Customers </li>
<li>Churn Rate = 1 - Repeat Rate </li>
</ul>

<b>Customer Lifetime Value Calculation</b><br/>
<ul>
<li>Average Order Value = Total Revenue / Total Number of Orders</li>
<li>Purchase Frequency =  Total Number of Orders / Total Number of Customers</li>
<li>CLTV = ((Average Order Value x Purchase Frequency)/Churn Rate) x Profit margin.</li>
<li>Customer Value = Average Order Value * Purchase Frequency</li>
</ul>

If a customer crosses his predicted purchase date, his CLV will be checked.<br/>
If the CLV is lower than the quantile of the churn rate then he wil be dropped from the promotion pool<br/>

If his CLV is higher that the quantile of the churn rate then he will be awarded with a coupon eligible for a week.<br/>
If he still doesnt purchase anything. He will be removed from the promotion pool.<br/>
